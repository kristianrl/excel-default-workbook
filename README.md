# Default workbook template for Microsoft Excel

This is a default workbook template for Microsoft Excel. In order to make it the default template once you start Excel, download the file and save it in a folder like:
`C:\Users\<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART`
or
`c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\XLSTART` (the folder name Program Files (x86) can vary)

If you are using a non-English version of Excel, you will likely need to rename *Book.xltx* to a file name corresponding to your Excel localization, e.g. *Mappe.xltx* (Danish)
